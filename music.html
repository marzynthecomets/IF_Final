            <h2>Did you know that there's a lot of math to music?</h2>
            <p>One of Mondrian's paintings was called <i>Broadway Boogie Woogie</i>.</p>

The squares are different sizes to represent notes of different length.">
            <p>Can you feel the rhythm in this painting?</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Music notes and fractions!</h2>
            <p>When musicians write music, they use music notation to help other musicians know what notes to play and how long to hold them!</p>
            <img src="musicnotationexample.png" alt="An example of a line of sheet music with notes.">
            <p>You can divide music notes into fractions! Play the notes to hear how music gets divided into fractions of time.</p>
            <p>A <b>whole</b> note is 4/4. It takes a whole measure, or amount of time, to play.</p>

            <p>A <b>half</b> note is 2/4. You can fit two half notes into the same measure as a whole note!</p>

            <p>A <b>quarter</b> note is 1/4. You can fit four quarter notes into a measure!</p>

            <h3>What fractions do you think are used in this measure?</h3>

            </audio>
            <p>It's these fractions: <b>1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16</b>! Or: a half note, quarter note, eighth note, and two sixteenth notes.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Making Rhythm!</h3>
            <p>You can start combining fractions to get different rhythms!</p>
            <p>Combine fractions like: <b>1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/16:</b></p>

            <p>A song written like this is called a <i>score</i>.</p>

            <h3>From the <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78682">MoMa:</a></h3>
            <p>Mondrian arrived in New York in 1940, one of the many European artists who moved to the United States to escape World War II. He immediately fell in love with the city and with boogie-woogie music, to which he was introduced on his first evening in New York. Soon he began, as he said, to put a little boogie-woogie into his paintings.

Mondrian’s aesthetic doctrine of Neo-Plasticism restricted the painter to the most basic kinds of line—that is, to straight horizontals and verticals—and to a similarly limited color range, the primary triad of red, yellow, and blue plus white, black, and the grays in between. But Broadway Boogie Woogie omits black and breaks Mondrian’s once uniform bars of color into multicolored segments. Bouncing against each other, these tiny, blinking blocks of color create a vital and pulsing rhythm, an optical vibration that jumps from intersection to intersection like traffic on the streets of New York. At the same time, the picture is carefully calibrated, its colors interspersed with gray and white blocks.

Mondrian’s appreciation of boogie-woogie may have sprung partly from the fact that he saw its goals as analogous to his own: “destruction of melody which is the destruction of natural appearance; and construction through the continuous opposition of pure means—dynamic rhythm.”<sup>1</sup></p>
