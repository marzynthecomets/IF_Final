            <h1>Math, Mondrian and Music!</h1>
            <h2>Did you know that there's a lot of math to music?</h2>
            <p>One of Mondrian's paintings was called <i>Broadway Boogie Woogie</i>.</p>

            <p>Can you feel the rhythm in this painting?</p>
            <h2>Music notes and fractions!</h2>
            <p>When musicians write music, they use music notation to help other musicians know what notes to play and how long to hold them!</p>
            <img src="musicnotationexample.png">
            <p>You can divide music notes into fractions! Play the notes to hear how music gets divided into fractions of time.</p>
            <p>A <b>whole</b> note is 4/4. It takes a whole measure, or amount of time, to play.</p>

                <source src="whole.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <p>A <b>half</b> note is 2/4. You can fit two half notes into the same measure as a whole note!</p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="half.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <p>A <b>quarter</b> note is 1/4. You can fit four quarter notes into a measure!</p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="quarter.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>   
            <p>An <b>eighth</b> note is 1/8. You can fit eight quarter notes into a measure!</p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="eighth.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <p>And <b>sixteenth</b> note is 1/16. You can fit sixteen sixteenth notes in a measure!</p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="sixteenth.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>   
            <h3>What fractions do you think are used in this measure?</h3>

            <audio controls>
                <source src="fractionated.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
            <p>It's these fractions: <b>1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16</b>! Or: a half note, quarter note, eighth note, and two sixteenth notes.</p>
            <h3>Making Rhythm!</h3>
            <p>You can start combining fractions to get different rhythms!</p>
            <p>Combine fractions like: <b>1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/16:</b></p>

            <p>A song written like this is called a <i>score</i>.</p>
